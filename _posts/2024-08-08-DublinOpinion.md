Bit by bit I am adding the old content back into mananamanana.com; today it's the turn of my content from the old group blog dublinopinion.com. Sadly the original website is defunct but I did manage to find what seems to be all of it (and it was a lot of stuff...) on the [wayback machine](https://archive.org). (On a sidenote, what an amazing resource is the wayback machine in these times of link rot and disappearing content). I retrieved all my blogposts from there - I seem to remember that I did a ton of writing there, but it seems in reality I only contributed 20+ posts.

Anyway, my contributions to that wide-ranging blog are now available here on [dublinopinion.mananamanana.com](https://dublinopinion.mananamanana.com). I was active there from 2006 to 2010, talking mostly about gigs and music, mostly in Dublin.
