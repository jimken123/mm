## Old stuff

*Ancient rain, falling down.*

[/twitter](https://jimken123.github.io/twitter/) - I was on twitter from 2008 to 2022, and now I'm no longer there because, well, you know. This is a backup archive of my account.

[/mananamanana blog](https://mananamanana.wordpress.com) - from 2008 to 2011 I ran the MananaManana blog, and it's still up there on WordPress.

[/dublinopinion blog](https://jimken123.github.io/dublinopinion/) - I was a contributor to the wide-ranging Dublin Opinion blog from 2006 to 2010, talking mostly about gigs and music. I retrieved my content from the wayback machine.

[/scotland trip reports](http://www.mananamanana.com/trip_reports.htm) - the bigger kayaking trips we went on from 2004 to 2007 are documented in these trip reports. All foreign kayaking trips are to Scotland, or some variant of that sceptered land.

[/herbert park rangers fc](http://mananamanana.com/hprfc/) - I commentated on Herbert Park Rangers FC, our hours-long football games in. This was my first website, on Geocities, now retrieved from the wayback machine.
